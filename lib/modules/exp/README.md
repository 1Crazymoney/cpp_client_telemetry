Experimentation client library is being deprecated and is not to be included in opensource release.

It contains two EXP client implementations:
* ECS Client
* AFD Client

In order to compile with EXP client, the following preprocessor definitions must be added:

#define HAVE_MAT_EXP
#define HAVE_MAT_FIFOSTORAGE
#define HAVE_MAT_JSONHPP
