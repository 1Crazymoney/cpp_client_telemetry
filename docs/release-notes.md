## Version 3.0.289.1 (10/16/2018)

### New features

None

### Design Changes

New configuration - config["compat"]["dotType"]=false - allows to replace dots by underscores
in EventProperties.SetType(...) API call for C++ SDK. This is necessary for ODIN, Office
annotations and MDM exporters to work, replicating legacy v1 C++ SDK behavior. Note that
the default value is 'true', preserving dots in record.baseType, thus customers expecting
legacy v1 behavior must explicitly set this config value to boolean false.

### Bug Fixes

1458981 HTTP client crash inserting range into vector in onrequestcomplete
1403111 SDK stats improvements
1459042 EventProperties.SetType(...) not setting record.baseType

xxxxxxx DDV tool: ability to inspect HTTP payloads from a debug callback
xxxxxxx BVT: SDK re-initialize did not respect new configuration parameters
xxxxxxx BVT: LogManagerFactory C++11 magic-static must return a reference, not an obj instance
